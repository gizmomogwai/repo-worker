** Introduction
works your dirty [[https://code.google.com/p/git-repo/][repo]] git repositories with [[https://github.com/gizmomogwai/magit][magit]].

** Implementation notes
*** history
- after the history is calculated, the program is a single threaded tui app

*** tui
- no ncurses: http://xn--rpa.cc/irl/term.html
  - (easier to handle colors e.g.)
  - no dependency
- KEY_RESIZE to react on terminal resizes
- ansi colors are nice, but hard for clipping
